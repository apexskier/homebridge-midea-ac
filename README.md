# Homebridge Midea A/C

This is a homebridge plugin that supports specifically the Midea U-Shaped 12k BTU Window Air Conditioner (model MAW12AV1QWT) that I got from Costco.

I've customized this fork pretty highly to my specific use cases, feel free to fork to customize for yours. I enable an outdoor temperature sensor, and expose a separate "fan" accessory so I can use it without the AC.
